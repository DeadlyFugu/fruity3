# Fruity 3.0

This repository contains the interpreter for Fruity 3, as well as the standard modules, some example code, and the website source code.

## Building

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, but any Unix-like OS should be sufficient. The following dependencies are required:

- `libgc`
- `libreadline`
- `libpcre2` (optional, use `make fp` instead of `make` to avoid this)

To compile and install, run the following commands. Remove `-b v3.0` to instead install the latest in-development version.

```
$ git clone -b v3.0 https://github.com/DeadlyFugu/fruity3.git
$ cd fruity3
$ mkdir build
$ make
$ make install
```

The last line will likely require super user permission (it writes to `/usr/local`). You can instead install to `~/.local` with the below command. Installing elsewhere is not recommended as these two paths are hardcoded into the binary (see `module.c`).

```
$ make install INSTALL_DIR=~/.local
```

## Documentation

Currently the only documentation available is the website. The live version can be found at <http://fruity.sekien.net/>. It is generated by running the below commands.

```
cd web
fp -l gen.fj
```
